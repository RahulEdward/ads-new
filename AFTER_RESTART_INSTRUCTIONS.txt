IMPORTANT: YOU MUST RESTART YOUR PC NOW.

The installation log says: "Changes will not be effective until the system is rebooted."
Since the installation involves Windows System components (WSL), a restart is mandatory.

AFTER RESTARTING YOUR PC:

1. Open the "Start" menu and search for "Ubuntu". Open it.
   - It will say "Installing, this may take a few minutes".
   - It will ask for a **Username** (e.g., "admindev") and **Password**.

2. Once you are inside the Ubuntu terminal, type these commands line by line (press Enter after each):

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
   (Type your password if asked)

   ```bash
   sudo apt install redis-server -y
   ```

   ```bash
   sudo service redis-server start
   ```

3. Your Redis will now be running inside Ubuntu!

4. Connect your backend:
   It should connect automatically to `localhost:6379`.

IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO RESTART NOW:
You can use the 'run_redis.bat' file in your 'd:\ads-app' folder to run Redis immediately using the Windows version we downloaded earlier.
